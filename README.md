# University System
I learnt from Edubook that I need to go slow but safe, and I'm proud of following that rule in this project.
This is a univerity system developed in ReactJs, JavaScript and Google Firebase (STILL IN DEVELOPING).

University System funcionalities:
- As a student, you can see your grades, rate your teachers (the way they explain the topics, knowledge, if they stop to explain topics that may be difficult for some students, etc).
- If you are a teacher, you are able to grade students, leave them a comment/tip, see your grade according to your student's criteria, see your personal information and being able to change it if you wish to.
- As an admin, you are able to see everything, change roles, change groups, add/delete/modify students to a group and a teacher's subject.

COMING UPDATES:
- A new role will be added, "School services", for the people who are going to manage students and teachers information. 
- I also need to add "Personal Information" section for teachers, and the menu for the role of school services.
